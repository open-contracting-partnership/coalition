summary: "Transparent and open RRF spending is attainable and realistic. To support the European Commission and Member States in establishing the right mechanisms for this, the Open Spending EU Coalition has come up with concrete, practical recommendations. These recommendations focus on exactly what should be published proactively, and how this information can be published to facilitate multi-stakeholder participation and monitoring.  

Our guide is designed for all such scenarios, providing recommendations which can form the basis of a new open spending initiative and/or serve to inform strengthening of pre-existing transparency. The document is open to public consultations. We welcome any feedback by adding a comment in the text by 20th December 2021."
