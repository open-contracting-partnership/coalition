      <title>Open Spending EU Coalition Guidance on the Transparency of the RRF Spending</title>

      <description>Transparent and open RRF spending is attainable and realistic. To support the European Commission and Member States in establishing the right mechanisms for this, the Open Spending EU Coalition has come up with concrete, practical recommendations. These recommendations focus on exactly what should be published proactively, and how this information can be published to facilitate multi-stakeholder participation and monitoring.
Our guide is designed for all such scenarios, providing recommendations which can form the basis of a new open spending initiative and/or serve to inform strengthening of pre-existing transparency. The document is open to public consultations. We welcome any feedback by adding a comment in the text by 20th December 2021.</description>

      <description>Openness in procurement can improve procurement in multiple ways, including more integrity, efficiency, level playing field, etc. Find a list of available evidence below:
Open procurement improves public integrity by deterring fraud and corruption  Academic research shows that improved openness and transparency is good for public integrity, value for money and competition. A study of more than 3.5 million government contracts across Europe determined that every additional item of information shared about a tender decreases the risk of a single bid contract.</description>

What we advocate for We are working at the national and EU levels to advance the principles of openness in spending of funds, procurement, and company ownership within the EU.
