      <description>In view of Russia&amp;rsquo;s military action against the Ukrainian people, being concerned about ensuring that European funds are spent as effectively as possible and in order to facilitate monitoring of the activities of sanctioned individuals and their associates: we call on the European Union and its Member States to take urgent steps to increase the transparency of spending of public funds, and we demand immediate action to deliver long-promised and genuine transparency of Beneficial and Company Ownership Registries.</description>

      <title>A Whitepaper on Opening up Recovery and Resilience Facility Spending</title>
      <link>https://www.open-spending.eu/posts/rff_guidance_published/</link>

      <description>The Recovery and Resilience Facility is the largest contribution to Member States in the history of the European Union. Their aim is to support reforms, infrastructure and the improvement of the quality of life of millions of EU citizens. We all have a responsibility to ensure that it is spent transparently and for its intended purpose. At the same time, the regulations introducing the RRF at EU level have not guaranteed full openness of spending. For this reason the Open Spending EU Coalition has produced Guidance to show Member State governments what detailed information should be published about the spending of these funds. The Guidance can also be used by civil society organisations, journalists, and others who want to persuade their governments to be more transparent about how public money is spent. The Coalition will support such actions and will work towards their implementation. In the publication we also presented recommendations addressed to the European Commission. We believe that the best solution that supports openness of EU funds is centralised and transparent information about them.</description>

      <title>Open Spending EU Coalition Guidance on the Transparency of the RRF Spending</title>
      <link>https://www.open-spending.eu/posts/guidance_rrf_transparency/</link>

      <description>Transparent and open RRF spending is attainable and realistic. To support the European Commission and Member States in establishing the right mechanisms for this, the Open Spending EU Coalition has come up with concrete, practical recommendations. These recommendations focus on exactly what should be published proactively, and how this information can be published to facilitate multi-stakeholder participation and monitoring.
Our guide is designed for all such scenarios, providing recommendations which can form the basis of a new open spending initiative and/or serve to inform strengthening of pre-existing transparency. The document is open to public consultations. We welcome any feedback by adding a comment in the text by 20th December 2021.</description>

      <description>Openness in procurement can improve procurement in multiple ways, including more integrity, efficiency, level playing field, etc. Find a list of available evidence below:
Open procurement improves public integrity by deterring fraud and corruption  Academic research shows that improved openness and transparency is good for public integrity, value for money and competition. A study of more than 3.5 million government contracts across Europe determined that every additional item of information shared about a tender decreases the risk of a single bid contract.</description>

      <description>Who we are We are a collaboration of non-government organisations and professionals working to ensure that government spending is done fairly, openly, efficiently, and creates the best value for money and best outcomes for Europe.
What we advocate for We are working at the national and EU levels to advance the principles of openness in spending of funds, procurement, and company ownership within the EU.
Transparent spending of EU Funds Disclosure requirements on the spending of EU funds are inadequate.</description>
